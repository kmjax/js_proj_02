### Project: Four More JavaScript Exercises


#### DESCRIPTION

Contains a base "menu" page to link and run four Javascript Exercises:
1. Loop that logs numbers between 50 and 100 in the console.
1. Function that accepts two numbers and calculates an area based on those two numbers.
1. Create an empty array. Use a prompt to push the users input into the array.
1. Simple TODO List. Initialize an empty array and prompt the user to insert a new todo list item. Add that todo item to the array. Iterate over the array and log the todo list in the console. Note: use a while loop to keep prompting the user for input until they type "QUIT".
